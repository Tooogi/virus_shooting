# virus_shooting

My first code for practicing vanilla JavaScript.

# The Game

The viruses move from left to right at varying brightness levels, making it easy for a virus to sneak up. The player must aim and click their mouse to shoot them down before they reach the end of the screen.

# Further Options

- Add a countdown timer.
- Add "start" button to begin playing
- Increase the speed of the enemies, making it more challenging for the player to shoot them down.
- Add scoring system. The player's score is based on how many enemies they were able to shoot down before the game ended.
- Add player's life.
- The game ends when an enemy reaches the end of the screen or when the player's life runs out. 
- Add replay button to the game to try and beat their previous high score.
- Store the player's score.
